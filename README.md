## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`) and fill in your Firebase credentials. Expo will inline variables prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` at build time:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

Security notes:

- Do not commit `.env` files. Only commit `.env.example`.
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` vars are exposed to the client. Don’t put server-only secrets here.
- The app validates required vars at runtime and throws helpful errors if missing.

### For mobile development:

- **iOS**: Xcode (macOS only)
- **Android**: Android Studio
- **Device Testing**: Expo Go app on your mobile device

## Getting Started

4. Set up authentication providers (Email/Password recommended)

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npx expo start
```

### 5. Run on Your Device/Emulator

After starting the dev server, you'll see a QR code and options:

#### Option A: Physical Device (Recommended for testing camera features)

1. Install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) on your phone
2. Scan the QR code with your camera (iOS) or Expo Go app (Android)

#### Option B: iOS Simulator (macOS only)

```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

#### Option C: Android Emulator

```bash
npx expo run:android
```

#### Option D: Web Browser

```bash
npx expo start --web
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the Expo development server
- `npm run android` - Start on Android emulator/device
